== Not important for the paper == 

* generate homophily plots for:  birth date, join date, join age and
  weight (cats only).
** makes sense only when a large assortativity has already been observed. 

* Joint distribution of cats+dogs counts per household (how should this be plotted) 

* Quickly check for information about deceased pets.  Note that many pets are deceased without this being indicated. 
** hamster:  age contains "heaven"
** key words:  we'll miss you, heaven, RIP, R.I.P., in loving memory,
   (DATE - DATE), im memoriam, in memorium [sic] 
** key word in name:  "the late"

* hamster:  most common foods

* Check whether cats and dogs have more properties which are not
  extracted at the moment.  (Add code to entcat and entdog) 
** #likes
** #views
** #corralled
** pet-peeves
** favorite toy
** favorite nap spot
** favorite food
** skills
** dwells (indoors / outdoors)
** lives remaining
** nicknames
** favorite walk

* country:  there are still some wrongly-parsed strings which are not actually countries in dat-petster/country.*

* check which geolocations contain multiple results.  what to do with them?
** do nothing; the first result is the one we use already 

* birthday (not birth date) distribution for all pets 
* joinday distribution for all pets 

* latlong plots:  generate a plot showing only the USA. 
* latlong plots:  overlay all pets, in a way to show which areas to
  predominantly cats or dogs. 

* network level comparison plots (overlay for both networks and all
  three species)  
** distance distributions

* Also perform regression for only pet properties and only friendship
  network properties.  

* additional features:  #likes, #views, #corralled.
