long-description: This is the bipartite network of entities from DBpedia and their affiliated countries. Each edge in the network connects an entity (such as a person) with a country associated with that person. The edges correspond to the &lt;http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country&gt; relationships in DBpedia. The countries include former countries, empires and kingdoms as well as disputed country-like entities; therefore, the number of country-nodes is much higher than the number of presently existing countries.
