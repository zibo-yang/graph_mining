long-description: Discogs (short for "discographies") is a large online music database that provides information about audio records including information about artists, labels and release details. Each edge of this bipartite network connects a label and a style. An edge indicates that the label was involved in the production of a release of the style. Releases can have multiple styles.  The left nodes represent labels and the right nodes represent styles.
