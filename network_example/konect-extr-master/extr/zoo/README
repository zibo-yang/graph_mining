This is the extraction and analysis code for the Slashdot Zoo. 

== Crawling ==

The zoo is extracted to $ZOO, which defaults to ~/zoodir.  This
zoodir contains the extracted data with one dir per user ($ZOO/user.*),
containing four files (friends, fans, foes, freaks).  Usernames are URL
encoded. 

Crawling is done by executing "./get".  This is a script which crawls
continuously and which can be interupted and restarted when necessary. 

Requirements:  perl, wget 

=== Important files ===

get -- the extraction proper
analysis -- statistics
progress -- progress chart
mk* -- scripts to generate the corresponding out.* file


== Analysis ==

Analysis of the Slashdot Zoo is done using a Matlab, and the Large
Graph Library LGL (version 1.1 works). 

Files can be generated using the Makefile. 

out.* -- files generated automatically
out.corpus -- The whole corpus with one relation per line
out.userids -- mapping between usernames and userids.  Userids begin at
	1 and are continuous.
out.matrix -- The whole corpus in Matlab readable format (one relation
	per line, using userids and +1/-1 as relation).
out.stat -- Statistics generated using Matlab
out.pred -- Prediction statistics
*.{ps,eps,png} -- figures generated automatically

=== Requirements ===

- GNU Make
- Matlab:  You need "matlab" in the path
- LGL-1.1:  Large Graph Layout, see file LGL

=== Environment ===

$verbose=1	output more
$fast=1		be faster but less accurate
