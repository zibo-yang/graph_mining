LGL is the large graph layout package.  Installation is very ad-hoc.  I
tested version LGL-1.1.   Set $LGL to the LGL root package.  


How to setup LGL
================

To configure LGL:  only run setup.pl -i, then put lglayout2D in the path.  
(We don't need lgl.pl)

To compile the java programs:  cd Java && CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:`pwd`" ./build.sh
(Apparently their java has "." in the path per default.)
