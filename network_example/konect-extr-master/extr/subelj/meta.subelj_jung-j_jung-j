long-description: This is the software class dependency network of the JUNG 2.0.1 and javax 1.6.0.7 libraries, namespaces edu.uci.ics.jung and java/javax. The network is directed. Nodes represent classes. An edge between them indicates that there exists a dependency between two classes. As there may be multiple references between classes the network has multiple edges.
