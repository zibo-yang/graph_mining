Hi Jerome,

Please find the attached data set from one experiment. We have
conducted serveral experiments.

You can find the description of our data in the following two papers

Impact of Human Mobility on Opportunistic Forwarding Algorithms
Augustin Chaintreau, Pan Hui, Jon Crowcroft, Christophe Diot, Richard
Gass, and James Scott
IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, Volume 6, Issue 6 (June 2007)

BUBBLE Rap: Social-based Forwarding in Delay Tolerant Networks
Pan Hui, Jon Crowcroft and Eiko Yoneki
In proceeding on the 9th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc
Networking and Computing (MobiHoc), HongKong, May, 2008.

I also working on social network and spaming protection. we can
arrange further meetings if you are interested in discussion.

cheers
Ben





"contacts.Exp3.dat"
is a file which describes the contact that were recorded by all
devices we distributed during this experiment.

========================
Examples taken from table.Exp3.dat (two first columns and first rows)
========================
1       8       121     121     1       0
1       3       236     347     1       0
1       4       236     347     1       0
1       5       121     464     1       0
1       8       585     585     2       464
========================
========================

- The first column gives the ID of the device who recorded the sightings.
- The second column gives the ID of the device who was seen
(it may be an iMote, or another device recorded during the experiment).

- The third and fourth column describe, respectively, the first and
last time when the address of ID2 were recorded by ID1 for this
contact.

- The fifth and sixth column are here for reading convenience. The
fifth enumerate contacts with same ID1 and ID2, as 1,2,... . The last
column describes the time difference between the beginning of this
contact and the end of the previous contact with same ID1 and ID2. It
is by convention set to 0 if this is the first contact for this ID1
and ID2.

- Note, again, that these contacts may not be mutual between a pair of
iMotes, because scanning period of different iMotes are not
synchronized, and because the sightings might not be symmetric.

Location: Conference IEEE Infocom in Grand Hyatt Miami

Date: March 2005

Duration:
          Devices distributed on March 7th, 2005 between lunch time and 5pm.
          Devices collected on March 10th, 2005 in the afternoon.

Participants:
50 students, attending the student workshop.

Collected datas:
- 2 iMotes were lost, and 7 did not deliver useful data, as a consequence
of accidental hardware reset. Contacts with any of these were discarded
from the traces of other iMotes to avoid any consequence on the
experimental results.

- The first six hours were discarded, as people were attending the
same workshop
during the first afternoon.

- Details of ID number:
        ID 1-41 are corresponding to iMotes (Class 1)
        ID 42-274 corresponds to external devices (Class 2)

Of the fifty-four iMotes distributed, forty-one yielded
useful data, eleven did not contain useful data because of various failures
with the battery and packaging, and two were not returned.
