# Makes a dataset symmetric. Loops are not removed. Edge weights and
# timestamps are allowed, and are preserved. mkuniq1 must be called
# before.  
#
# STDIN
#	In OUT format, with possibly multiple edges.  Supports
#	timestamps and weights. 
#
# STDOUT
#	The same with any duplicate edges removed (in particular, edges
#	in opposite direction)
