These are scripts used to generate datasets from given files.

Most datasets come in text form, with one edge per line.  We usually run
a Sed script over them to convert them into KONECT format, and then use
the files in this directory for perform several transformations.  

There are two ways to do this:  
  - Use individual transformations
  - Use the all-in-one solution

In both cases, preprocessing scripts may be used. 

Note:  many scripts in this directory are deprecated. 

See each script for a detailed description of that script's function. 

Scripts in this directory are written in the shell, in Perl 5, in Sed,
and in AWK.  AWK is deprecated in favor of Perl 5. 


Preprocessing
=============

- mkskip:        Remove comment lines
- mksem:         Extract data from a "Semantic Web" file


Individual Transformations
==========================

Use individual scripts to perform individual tasks, such as removing
duplicates and symmetrizing a dataset.  Commonly used scripts are,
roughly in the order they should be used:

- mksym:         Make symmetric and unweighted
- mkrmdup:       Remove loops
- mkunweighted:  Make unweighted
- mkuniq1:       Give unique node IDs (for unipartite networks)
- mkuniq:        Give unique node IDs (for bipartite networks)
- rmmulti:	 Collapse multiple edges


All-in-one Solution
===================

Use 'mkrel' to generate the dataset at once.  This has lots of options. 

This method is semi-deprecated, but it is the only method that is able
to generate entity files.
